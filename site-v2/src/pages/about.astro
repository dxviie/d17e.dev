# Hi!

## Vandenbogaerde
#### or *d17e* for short.

With about **20 years** of experience in software development, I am now shifting my focus to using **code** as a way of turning **ideas** into **artistic expression**.

These take the shape of **plotter drawings**, **generative design tools** or **audio visualisations**... Most of the time.

I also love helping **businesses small & large** to build **better products** and **streamline** their processes.

Think your project could use some magic?<br/>[Let's have a chat!](https://forms.d17e.dev/contact)

const aboutContent = `
## What's on here?

Under the [posts](/posts) section you can find the stream of images and videos I produce documenting my progress. 
Where I can I also I add some of the story behind the content. Often in series of threes, as I might have some OCD going on, but nothing unmanageable. I promise.

The [blog](/articles) part houses my writing. For now, this is where you can find more long-form content.
I intend to expand on this part of my space here and create my version of a digital garden. But that's for later.
[Stay tuned?!](https://forms.d17e.dev/subscribe)

Then, last but not least, there's the [landing page](/). 
I'd been wondering how to make my landing page more engaging and user-friendly, but hadn't really come up with anything substantial.
That is until the recent Genuary '25 prompt: ['Grid-based graphic design'](https://genuary25.d17e.dev/prompt/29) sparked something.
That spark is now my landing page. I hope you like it.`;

## Connect

The source of all the stuff I do and create is right here, but I'm also on _the platforms_. 
Not _me_ per se, rather the robots ðŸ¤– I've typed and clicked into existence to do my social media bidding.
You can find me on:`;
