            <description>Postcards are in place and first color for the base layer done.

                I did pick one blue and one paint color that would be part of each of the three cards.
                In an attempt to ty everything a little bit together.
                But also a cheeky way limiting pen swaps :)

            <description>Picking colors for the postcard exchange organized by @penplotart

                I really love how I can now go to the art supply store, spend a silly amount of time staring at colors and whatnot, and feel
                like that was a completely sensible and useful way to spend my time...

                For these cards, I ended up using 4 different shades of blue for the &apos;base layer&apos; and 4 posca fineliners for the
                &apos;top layer&apos;. Both layers consist of two separate colors, giving each of the three cards a unique combination of
                blues and paints.

            <description>&apos;Plot Party&apos; is organized by @penplotart and part of it is a physical postcard exchange.
                The three addresses I received for this were in three different countries: Belgium, France and Germany. It just so happens
                that I&apos;d been in each of those countries relatively recently, which gave me the idea to use pictures I&apos;d taken in
                those places. This allowed each of the three cards to have their own story, while at the same time creating a connection
                with the receiver through my own memories.

                Here you see the image I used for the card headed for Germany. A picture I took one morning walking the dog while taking in
                the majesty of the black forest. Trees for days...

            <description>Plot Party October 2024 - Postcard Exchange - organized by @penplotart

                A little test running the layout through rstr.d17e.dev to generate plottable SVGs. I ended up rotating the image before
                processing to influence the results. I also made an inverted version to then later combine the outputs.

            <description>&quot;Plot Party&quot; is an online event organized by @penplotart where during the course of the event there&apos;s
                a prompt provided for each day. I decided to take part in the mini edition in October.
                Well, that&apos;s to say. I didn&apos;t actually end up doing any of the prompts as I got a bit overwhelmed with client and
                family work. However, these plot parties usually end with a &apos;postcard exchange&apos; for which I had registered. So
                when I received my 3 addresses, I knew I had to at least send those out.

                Recently I realized that next to famous paintings there&apos;s also something else that&apos;s super recognizable:
                Typography. Or just letters really. And words.

                So for this work, that&apos;s where I wanted to start. Using the words of &apos;plot party&apos; to turn into an abstract
                plotted mess. I tried laying out letters using existing fonts, but soon realized that wasn&apos;t going to bring me what I
                was looking for. So I took the tablet in hand and started drawing the letters with simple lines and shapes. And this is what
                I ended up with...

            <description>Well here it is ladies and gentlemen!

                The whole reason I&apos;ve been torturing with countless pictures of QR codes.
                I did it all for this.

                And it was totally worth it. And fun. Most of the time.

                If you want I can even make some for your business or project as well!

                Or if you&apos;re into that kind of stuff you find all the code on a branch of the &apos;bc-create-qr&apos; branch on the
                project&apos;s github page. Vercel puts all preview builds for branches behind auth by default. So that&apos;s how I
                implemented &apos;free auth&apos; on this one. The server routes integrate with my Directus CMS, but should be easy enough
                to swap out with whatever implementation you need.

                If you&apos;ve been around here long enough, you might recognize this stuff.
                This is a plot design I cut up for business cards.
                Don&apos;t worry. They were always supposed to be business cards :)

            <description>My cutting and plotting both have plenty of room for improvement, but I love how these are coming out. The paper is
                a 360gr Acryl Paper I picked, which really give them a nice and sturdy feel as well.

                But what&apos;s on the backside!?!

            <description>Here&apos;s a hint to the answer of why I&apos;d really like people to scan the QR code...

                But don&apos;t let that distract you from that beautiful happy accident in the bottom right corner.

            <description>Here&apos;s the plot layout of the card design I went with for the first couple of batches. I decided to remove any
                real contact information to the card itself as I really wanted to incentivise scanning the QR code...
                I hear you thinking why.
                That&apos;s a great question.

            <description>After some playing around with other styles, I came back around and settled on the &apos;plain&apos; style. The
                negative space of the &apos;dev&apos; took a couple of iterations to get right, but we got there...

            <description>So the whole reason I&apos;ve been delving into plotting QR codes was in fact *not* because I&apos;m an absolute
                fan of QR codes. I don&apos;t blame you for thinking differently as I&apos;ve been filling this place with QR codes lately.
                But well, they&apos;re merely a little step on the road to **making business cards great again**!

                Since everybody&apos;s making thing great again, again I figured there&apos;s no better time than now.

                So to kick it off, if I want to plot business cards, I&apos;ll also have to be able to plot my logo. Here&apos;s some of the
                attempts at that.

                But what now? What comes next?

            <description>For this little bit of Spielerei, I needed something the qr tool couldn&apos;t yet do. Which was turn an image into
                SVG. As it stood up until then, it would only turn a text into a qr code and then that code into SVG.

                So I set out to add this functionality. Though this time, I decided to re-implement the (fairly simple) algorithm, but this
                time cutting out the paperjs dependency and just generating the SVG straight into my Svelte component. The image is a WIP
                test while working on this.

                This ended up working so well that I threw out the paperjs and kept the new simpler and more efficient implementation. The
                additional functionality is still there, though you&apos;ll have to find it :)

            <description>Next up, I selected all the frames that were unique. As I had extracted 30 frames per second, a bunch of them were
                the same. I ended with 20 unique frames, converted them to SVG using an extension to the good old
                [qr.d17e.dev](https://qr.d17e.dev/astley) and then laid them out onto 1 A3 SVG in preparation of plotting...

            <guid isPermaLink="true">https://d17e.dev/qr-frame-extraction</guid>
            <description>The first thing I had to do was turn the gif into separate frames. For this is screen recorded the gif, turning it
                into an mp4. Then edited that into a square mp4 that was doing exactly 1 animation loop.

                Then to turn the video into frames, I used a command line tool named &apos;`ffmpeg`&apos;. More precisely I ran:

                `ffmpeg -i .\qr-astley-crop-square.mp4 -vf fps=30 qr_astley_frame_%06d.png`

                And tadaa. The result of that command you see above. I haven&apos;t know about **ffmpeg** all that long, but it&apos;s a
                real powerhouse when it comes to turning images into videos or vice versa. or changing the format of a video, like making
                sure it passes meta&apos;s whimsical upload requirements.

            <description>So around the time I was polishing up the little QR project, I came across this animated gif in my socials(\*). My
                first thought was &quot;🤣😂🤣&quot;, which was soon followed by &quot;Wait, what?! This works!?&quot;...

                After a quick test pausing the clip at several points in time I realised all of these frames were valid QR codes. I&apos;d
                never seen anything like it, so I was very intrigued...

                Naturally, the following question that popped into my head was &quot;Hmm,... I wonder if I can plot these?&quot;...
                So, what do you think?
                Could I?
                Should I?
                Would I?...


                (\*) As I mentioned, I came across this gif on a social media platform. As I&apos;m sharing it here, I tried figuring out
                who made this. The internet told me it was @zackfreedman but Zack himself told me it was someone on his Discord. And it was.
                Somebody going by the name &apos;Repeated Failure&apos;. I had a feeling we&apos;d get along in real life. Our conversation
                wasn&apos;t much more than an acknowledgement that he&apos;d made this QR originally after which silence ensued. However, I
                was able to find this [qr-convert Github repo](https://github.com/RepeatedFailure/qr_convert) by someone going by the same
                moniker... That on its turn seems to be relying on a python package named &apos;amazing-qr&apos; (what&apos;s in a name?).

                A while later I also somehow stubmeld on [the actual tweet from
                2022](https://x.com/repeatedfailure/status/1519353127983587330)

            <description>Plottable QR codes all good and well, but what does that even mean?
                Well, I can&apos;t tell you what it *means*, but I can show you...

                Here you see the plotting in action at 1.38x the actual speed to fit into a 30 second clip. In real time this took \~39
                seconds to plot. As you might be able to tell I pushed the speed settings on the Axidraw towards the maximum for this test.
                For reference, on my regular speed settings (relatively slow) the same code still only took about \~42 seconds.

                Yet, no matter how long it takes, I have a hard time looking away.

            <description>In case you&apos;ve been around here for a while, you may have seen some plotted QR codes pop by. Well, I&apos;ve
                finally put some time in polishing that tiny project and put it out there.

                So, right now you can go and get your own plottable QR&apos;s over at [qr.d17e.dev](https://qr.d17e.dev)

                Even though this really is a tiny project, I spent quite some time in getting all the little details right. Over time, the
                UI became a lot less cluttered and functionality got cut, all to make it do just 1 thing and do it right. A big shout out to
                @muffinman_io for his valuable feedback and *inspiration* for the mobile UX, which just accidentally looks exactly the same
                like [pulsar&apos;s](https://muffinman.io/pulsar/).

                For those interested, source code is on my Github.

                Now let&apos;s hope that gif actually looks like something 🤞🙃

            <description>So I tried installing [saxi](https://github.com/nornagon/saxi) on the raspberrypi I&apos;ve got lying around...
                Apparently something changed in the way Debian deals with serial communication. Or at least that&apos;s as far as I got.

                After trying several node versions and other hacks, I couldn&apos;t get saxi to talk to my plotter. I even tried breathing
                some life in the old (mid 2011!) Mac Mini as my print server. Needless to say that didn&apos;t go well either.

                So here, you are looking at the solution to my overheating laptop. I gave it another go, while keeping a close eye on all
                the built-in temperature sensors. Turns out there&apos;s quite a couple of them sprinkled around, which allowed me to figure
                out the spot that was getting the warmest, and... tadaa &quot;fixed&quot; !🫠

                Until I find some time to delve deep into the bowels of saxi at least...

            <description>I&apos;ve plotted exactly 75% of the frames here...

                Somehow, everytime I find some time to put into this project, I&apos;m faced with a new challenge. This time during the
                fourth and final plot, the laptop in charge of the axidraw kept overheating and stopping mid plot. In fairness, he&apos;s
                pretty old and a bit tucked away in an uneasy spot...

                I figured I might as well get rid of the thing as axidraw controller and finally set up that raspberrypi @muffinman_io
                generously gifted me. Doing things I had been meaning to do for a long time seemed to be what this plot wanted from me
                anyway...

            <description>The previous failed plot made me realize that the blue was still very blue... And I didn&apos;t want the sky to
                play such a big role in the whole thing. Afterall, it seems like I&apos;m going with a &apos;metro.gif&apos; kind of
                titling. Not &apos;blue-sky-really-its-very-blue-sky.gif&apos;.

                That&apos;s when I realised I&apos;d also bought these very thin copic (r) fineliners in sepia and warm grey. This was
                followed up with another lightbuld where I realised different fineline thicknesses could bring in their own character and
                color...

                Turns out there&apos;s a reason these super thin fineliners seem to be discontued. They start out alright, but very quickly
                loose their *inkiness* or whatever you want to call it... but hey. I do like how this looks. I guess that&apos;s something
                :)

            <description>After the last fiasco, I realised I should probably plot just 1 frame first to see if I actually like how it looks
                like. Something about seeing all that blue on the failed plot made me realise that it was... well, very blue.

                Let&apos;s try how just one frame looks like I tought.

                Well, the axidraw decided that it was just going to stop actually putting the pen down on the paper. It was still doing all
                the movements. Just none of the drawing.

                I figure the axidraw knew I had a brandnew **brushless** servo sitting just a few feet away from where it was doing its
                thing. As changing to the new servo had been one of those items that hang forever in the middle of a todo-list, I happily
                complied.

                Another plot half-done. But the axidraw was now more than ready to give it another go...

            <description>While plotting the first layer, being around 80% done after plotting for about an hour and a half, my axidraw
                decided that the y-axis was sitting in the wrong place and jumped down 2 cm.

                The lesson here was not to try and plot all the way up to very edge of the plottable A3 area. As you can see on the right,
                my calibration markers aren&apos;t even on the page. Moral of the story: if you tell your robot to go somewhere it can&apos;t,
                it&apos;s gonna do its best and try to go there anyway. If it slips a gear or two while trying, that&apos;s on you, and that&apos;s
                ok.

                As I looked at the boulder rolling back to the bottom of the mountain, I thought &quot;next one will be better, for sure&quot;.

            <description>The real reason I was looking for a subject to &apos;rstr&apos; was really just to try out the bunch of new colored
                fineliners I&apos;d gotten. First to the races was the blue Pigma Micron 05.

                For those familiar with the axidraw, note in the top left that it&apos;s still sporting the classic (brushfull?) servo it
                came with...

            <description>As I was playing around putting these pictures through rstr, I realised it would be great if it could use different
                colors...

            <description>I&apos;m not sure what it is exactly, but I have a fascination with the Bijlmer buildings. There&apos;s something
                with the straight concrete lines contrasting with their lush green surroundings. On top of that they also have a rich
                history for their relatively young age. In case you&apos;re interested to learn more, I can recommend the
                [99pi.org](http://99pi.org) (99 percent invisible) podcast on the &apos;Bijlmer&apos;.

                With that they felt like the perfect subject to get rstr&apos;d...

                Around the 24th of July I wrapped up implementing what I considered the core and necessary features for a first version.
                This will be an ongoing project for a while I believe, so expect more of this in the future...
                And if you have any ideas or remarks, let me know!

                In case you&apos;re curious what to see in the future, you should look for the awesome work by James Merrill titled
                **\`_Chaos Blocks&apos;_**

                Almost there... Turns out `shape.instersects(line)` and `line.instersects(shape)` give you the same intersecting points, but
                not in the same order. Which actually makes total sense. Being able to easily turn on interactivity with my shapes in
                paperjs was a real timesaver here...

                Once the grouping was working, it was time to fill the shapes. The original hatching algorithm didn&apos;t play well with
                anything that wasn&apos;t a rectangle though...

                Next up, we&apos;re grouping neighboring cells one by one. Each iteration each group can only grow once. I took a bit of a
                different approach for finding candidate neighbors than the original implementation, so at first I these groups were wildly
                growing within one iteration. But for this first version I wanted to respect the initial algorithm as much as possible, so I
                had to figure out a way to limit its growth. Which kind of works now. That we end up with Tetris shapes around iteration 3
                was unintentional. But welcomed.

                The whole algorithm is directed by the average color of each &apos;pixel&apos; in the initial grid, so that&apos;s also
                where we start. For this I&apos;m relying on paperjs and call `getAverageColor()` for each cell, which giving us access to
                the RGB, HSB/L color components. For now we&apos;re just looking at the &apos;gray&apos; value though... For now.

            <description>For the last couple of weeks, I have been revisiting the algorithm I wrote for the Genuary 2024 Vera Molnar prompt.
                The idea behind it was to transform an image into a series of simple straight lines inspired by Molnar&apos;s work titled
                &quot;A la recherche de Paul Klee&quot;.

                This has been an algorithm I&apos;ve had quite some of fun with myself by turning images of friends, family and myself into
                plottable messes (including my avatar image). So I thought it would be great to share that with the world.

                So now, you can head over to [https://rstr.d17e.dev,](https://rstr.d17e.dev) upload your own images and play around with it.

                As it stands now, it is a re-implementation of the original one I did back in january but with one key difference that it is
                now &apos;interactive&apos;. Which means that you can fiddle around with the parameters that drive the process under the
                hood _and_ you can actually see the algorithm at work. Which can be pretty mesmerizing to look at.

                I have a whole bunch of ideas on how to expand on this algorithm, so expect more features and whatnot in the future. But
                before I do any of that, I&apos;ll make sure to optimize the SVG export. Let me know if there&apos;s something you&apos;d
                like to see this do in the future.

                In the mean time, take care and have fun!

            <description>Continuing on the same bit, but we&apos;re now adding a second gradient output and then mixing them together for
                the final output:

                ```
                speed = .33

                osc(10, [.2, -.4, .04].smooth(0.05), [0, Math.PI/2].smooth(.1))
                .colorama([0.005,0.33,0.66,1.0].smooth(1))
                .luma(.3, .3)
                .posterize(7)
                .modulateRepeat(osc([3,13].fast(.5)).rotate(Math.PI/2)).out(o0)

                gradient(Math.PI)
                .rotate(5, .5)
                .repeat()
                .modulateRepeat(voronoi(9)).out(o1)

                src(o0).add(src(o1), 1)
                .modulateHue(osc())
                .luma(.7)
                .out(o2)

                render(o2)
                ```

            <description>A few weeks ago I had the pleasure to attend the live coding workshop at @c3devfest, where @tmhglnd introduced us
                to live coding audio with Mercury ([mercury.timohoogland.com](http://mercury.timohoogland.com)) while @sasj\_nl took care of
                the visual part and got us going with the live coding video synth Hydra ([hydra.ojack.xyz](https://hydra.ojack.xyz)) by
                @o\_jack

                I had a blast and got really inspired, especially playing around with Hydra. I&apos;m absolutely fascinated with what you
                can get out of it with just a few little bits of &apos;code&apos;. Thank you @sasj\_nl for the introduction and to @o\_jack
                for bringing hydra into the world.

                And to anybody else reading this, I recommend trying out both of these tools... I bet you&apos;ll have some fun, even if you
                don&apos;t know how to code.

                Now as for the video, below is the hydra code that generates it:

                ```
                osc(10, [.2,-.4,.04].smooth(0.05),[0,Math.PI/2].smooth(.1))
                .colorama([0.005,0.33,0.66,1.0].smooth(1))
                .out()
                ```

                One of the nifty things that hydra offers is the .smooth() method on arrays like in \[.2,-.4,.04\].smooth(0.05). This
                smoothens out transitions between these values over time. And that&apos;s just one of the nifty things...

                Stay tuned for more nifty hydra notes :)

                Here&apos;s some pictures by Eliana Gelman.
                The performance was recorded and is available on youtube, but will probably upload some short clips here soon...

            <description>I want to plot the end result of this escapade with fountain pens and ink, so I had to pick an ink.

                I ended up with this red ink named &apos;Poppy Red&apos; by Diamine. In hindsight not sure if it&apos;s the best choice, but
                seemed fitting.

            <description>I am very happy with how this turned out.
                Will probably try and wrap this up as a little online tool, make sure to let me know if that&apos;s something you would be
                interested in...

            <description>After some work I got the algorithm to incorporate the target qr size, and the pen tip sizes.
                After that and some more iterations, I had a single line scannable plot (.8 pen) that only takes 1m 40s

                Great success!

                Now _all_ that&apos;s left is to build the website the qr is pointing at...

            <description>...Took almost 20 minutes to plot using a 0.05 pen.
                Great stuff. But plenty of room for improvement :)

            <description>I have an idea for which I&apos;d like to able to plot QR code with my Axidraw, so I got my hands on an npm package
                that generates qr-codes in SVG and let InkScape figure it out.

                The attempt failed. Failed beautifully.

                soup of pixels I&apos;d never intended to see. Now I deeply understood and agreed.
